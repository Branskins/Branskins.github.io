  I found out that there is posible to write Javascript code to run in the Raspberry Pi thanks to
  a popular robotics programming framework called Johnny-Five. Also, Johnny-Five programs can be written
  in many other platforms like Arduino and experiment with popular libraries such as Express.js.
</p>
<p>
  For more detailed information about <strong>Johnny-Five</strong>, visit the
  official <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Github</a> page or
  visit their <a href="http://johnny-five.io/">website</a>.</p>
<p>
  In order to make that Johnny-Five works on the <strong>Raspberry Pi</strong>,
  is necessary to do an extra step. Look for some information in the Wiki
  section of this <a href="https://github.com/nebrius/raspi-io">Github</a> repository.</p>
<p>Here it is where I started, I only make a simple blinking LED, the equivalent to a "Hello World".</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const five = require('johnny-five');
const raspi = require('raspi-io');

const board = five.Board({
   io: new raspi() // It tells to Johnny-Five that is working on a Raspberry Pi
});

board.on('ready', () => {
   const red = new five.Led('P1-11'); // GPIO17
   red.blink();
});
{% endhighlight %}

<p>
  When everything is connected, the Raspberry is configured and the code is correctly typed,
  the led should turn on (ignore all the cables and the button).
