<p>
  I found out that there is posible to write Javascript code to run in the Raspberry Pi thanks to
  a robotics programming framework called Johnny-Five. Also, Johnny-Five programs can be written
  in many other platforms like Arduino and experiment with popular libraries such as Express.js.
</p>
<p>For more detailed information, visit the official <a href="https://github.com/rwaldron/johnny-five">Github</a> page.</p>
<p>Here is where I started, I only make a simple blinking LED, like a "Hello World".</p>

{% highlight javascript %}
const five = require('johnny-five');
const raspi = require('raspi-io');

const board = five.Board({
   io: new raspi() // It tells to Johnny-Five that is working on a Raspberry Pi
});

board.on('ready', () => {
   const red = new five.Led('P1-11'); // GPIO17
   red.blink();
});
{% endhighlight %}
