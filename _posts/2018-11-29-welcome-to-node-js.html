<p>Using <strong>JavaScript</strong> as a server-side programming language.</p>
<p>
  I was struggling with the Node basic concepts (HTTP, Stream, Buffer, Module) because I first started
  with no background knowledge about server-side programming. That made me feel quite lost for a while
  because I was just writing code in Node but I was not understanding at what I was doing.
</p>
<p>
  At the end I realized that I was making a mistake, which is very common when starting something new.
  Therefore, I decided to take a look for the core elements that involves server-side programming before
  getting a mess in my head.

<h2>NodeSchool</h2>
<p>Open source lesson modules that teach web software skills. I started to learn Node.js here.</p>

<p>Here it is one of the code challenges from the NodeSchool modules</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
// An HTTP server that serves the sames text file for each request it receives.

var http = require('http')
var fs = require('fs')
var port = Number(process.argv[2]) // port provided
var folder = process.argv[3]; // location of the file

var server = http.createServer(function(req, res) {
  res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/plain'})
  fs.createReadStream(folder).pipe(res)
})
server.listen(port)
{% endhighlight %}
