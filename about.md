Welcome! :eyes:

I am Andrés Jiménez, a system engineering student. This is my personal site
where I would like to share my experiences, difficulties and learnings when
I build and use software.

My plan is to show the process of my personal projects and the future ideas
that I have in mind.

Feel free to make a Pull Request telling me that you were here, I would
appreciate your comments.
